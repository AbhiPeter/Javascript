        difference in substring ,substr and slice

        - here in substring you need to specify the strt and end but in substr you need to specfiy the stra but not end
        -in substr the end must be with the index value where you want to end

        for exmaple :- i am from angualr avengers

        str1.substring(10,17)  - here 10 indicated the start where 17 indcticase the end 
        str1.substr(10,7) - here the 10 indicates the strart while 7 includes the index value till which you need to specify

        -slice method also take the 2 arugments strat and end 
        -when you specify the negative value the search strats froom the end of the string
        -if end is not specifed then it shown the all character

        - in substring if the number is greater than the end then it can also swap as required
        -in substring the negative number are convereted in the zeros
