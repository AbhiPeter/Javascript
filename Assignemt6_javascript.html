    hosting is the concept where you are displaying a varible and then you are declaring the varible
    
    //alert(a);
    //var a;
    
    here variable hosting is there as we have dispalyed a and then we have declared
    
-->

    <Script>
        document.write(a);
        //here the hosting is done in the javascript
        var a;
    </script>

    <!--

I dont think there is any advantage of writing the hostiing in javascript as the varible gets undefined 
so its better always you assign the variable and then disaply it

also when you call funtion or disaply the variable without decalring it call cuase error too

you can aviod it make sure before dispalying anything you have to declare the variable
